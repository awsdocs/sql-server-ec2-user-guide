# What is Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon EC2?<a name="sql-server-on-ec2-overview"></a>

You can run Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)\. Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system \(RDBMS\) whose primary purpose is to store and retrieve data\. SQL Server includes additional services, such as Analysis Services \(SSAS\), Reporting Services \(SSRS\), Integration Services \(SSIS\), and Machine Learning \(ML\)\. AWS provides a comprehensive set of services and tools to deploy Microsoft SQL Server on the reliable and secure AWS Cloud infrastructure\. The benefits of running SQL Server on AWS include cost savings, scalability, high availability and disaster recovery, improved performance, and ease of management\. For more information, see [Learn why AWS is the best cloud to run Microsoft Windows Server and SQL Server workloads](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/learn-why-aws-is-the-best-cloud-to-run-microsoft-windows-server-and-sql-server-workloads/) on the AWS Compute blog\.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) supports a self\-managed SQL Server\. That is, it gives you full control over the setup of the infrastructure and the database environment\. Running SQL Server on Amazon EC2 is very similar to running SQL Server on your own server\. You have full control of the database and operating system\-level access, so you can use your choice of tools to manage the operating system, database software, patches, data replication, backup, and restoration\. You are responsible for data replication and recovery across your instances in the same or different AWS Regions\. For more information, refer to the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)\.

## Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon EC2 features<a name="sql-server-on-ec2-features"></a>

SQL Server on Amazon EC2 provides the following features:
+ **Flexible licensing options** — When you use Amazon EC2 instances with the license included, you are using instances with fully\-compliant Windows Server and SQL Server that are licensed through AWS\. Flexible BYOL options include default tenant EC2 for products that are eligible for [Microsoft License Mobility through Software Assurance](http://aws.amazon.com/windows/resources/licensemobility/), as well as [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/) and [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/dedicated-instances/)\. You can use [AWS License Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/license-manager.html) to track the usage of software licenses and reduce the risk of non\-compliance\. For more information, see [Licensing](http://aws.amazon.com/windows/faq/#licensing) in the *Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Frequently Asked Questions*\.
+ **High performance block storage** — [Amazon Elastic Block Store](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs) provides multiple options for high\-performance block storage for Microsoft SQL Server\. EC2 Instances using [io2 Block Express](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/provisioned-iops/) give you the highest block storage performance with a single storage volume\. Other SSD\-backed Amazon EBS options include io2 volumes for business\-critical applications and gp3 volumes for general purpose applications\. Amazon EBS also offers crash\-consistent snapshots, and enables application\-consistent snapshots through Windows VSS \(Volume Shadow Copy Services\) to help protect your SQL Server deployments\.
+ **Fully\-managed shared storage** — [Amazon FSx for Windows File Server](http://aws.amazon.com/fsx) and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP offer fully\-managed shared storage for high\-availability SQL Server failover cluster instances \(FCI\) workloads\.
+  **Windows\-based services** — [AWS Directory Service](http://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice) offers managed Microsoft Active Directory with identity and access management\.
+  **Scalable processors** — [Intel Xeon Scalable Processors on AWS](https://pages.awscloud.com/gc-500-Running-Windows-Workloads-learn.html) provide you with better data protection, faster processing of more data volumes, and increased service flexibility for Amazon EC2\.
+ **Migration programs** — AWS offers programs for migration for customers looking to migrate SQL Server workloads to AWS\. AWS [Migration Acceleration Program \(MAP\) for Windows](http://aws.amazon.com/windows/map-for-windows/) provides services, best practices, and tools to help you save costs and accelerate your migration on AWS\.
+ **Windows workload optimization** — After you move your SQL Server workloads to AWS, you can continue to optimize costs, usage, and licenses to suit your business requirements\. With [Cost Explorer Service](http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/), you can visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time\. [AWS Compute Optimizer](http://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/) recommends optimal AWS compute resources for your workloads so that you can reduce costs up to 25% by analyzing historical utilization data\. [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/cost-optimization-checks.html) can check that your EC2 instances have the required amount of SQL Server licenses and that the EC2 instance vCPU count doesn’t exceed what is permitted for the SQL Server edition\. [AWS Managed Services](http://aws.amazon.com/managed-services/) can help operate your cloud environment post\-migration by analyzing alerts and responding to incidents, reducing operational overhead and risk\. You can use [AWS Systems Manager](http://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager) to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources and better manage your infrastructure at scale\.

  AWS can help you to modernize you Windows\-based applications with AWS open source services if you want to reduce the high cost of commercial licensing\. Options include running SQL Server database applications on Linux, moving workloads to [Amazon Aurora](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora), containerizing your Windows applications with [Amazon EKS](http://aws.amazon.com/eks), going serverless with [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda), or taking advantage of micro\-services based architecture\.
